### Features

* **ffe-radio-button-react:** Reimplement ([5734d87](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/5734d87))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ffe-radio-button-react:** This commit reimplements the
`ffe-radio-button-react` package, and modernizes its APIs.

This change removes deprecated APIs, and instead takes a fresh approach
to improve the developer experience and design consistency.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of breaking changes:

*`<RadioButton />`*
- `aria-invalid` prop must be `'true'` or `'false'` now - no booleans!
- `invalid` prop is removed - use `aria-invalid`

*`<RadioSwitch />`*
- The `<RadioSwitch />` is no longer wrapped in a `RadioButtonGroup`
component! Wrap it yourself - create a wrapping component if it's a lot
of work for your usecase.
- `aria-invalid` prop must be `'true'` or `'false'` now - no booleans!
- `invalid` prop is removed - use `aria-invalid`
- `leftOption` object is now replaced by two props - `leftLabel` and
`leftValue`
- `rightOption` object is now replaced by two props - `rightLabel` and
`rightValue`.

*`<RadioButtonInputGroup />`*
- This component now requires you to pass a function as a child. You can
[read more about this pattern here](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html).
The function receives an object with all props relevant to all options.
Spread these to every radio button.
- `buttons` prop is deprecated - pass your choices in as children
- `aria-invalid` prop must be `'true'` or `'false'` now - no booleans!
- `invalid` prop is removed - use `aria-invalid`

Please refer to the documentation for usage examples.

Finally, this commit documents this package, which had previously
been forgotten about.

# 2.0.0 (2018-02-25)


### Bug Fixes

* **ffe-radio-button-react:** Do not create a new id on render ([ab38163](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/ab38163))
* **ffe-radio-button-react:** Repalce sdbm with uuid ([cb4fe00](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/cb4fe00))


### Chores

* add [@sb1](https://github.com/sb1)/ scope to all packages ([37efbb4](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/37efbb4))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* All packages have been renamed to add the @sb1 scope.

See links [1] and [2] to read more about package scopes.

Unfortunately this requires you update both your dependencies in
`package.json` and all `import` or `require` statements in your code.
Also, you unfortunately have to upgrade all FFE packages at once due to
dependency between packages. If you are on the latest version prior to
this breaking change the upgrade should be a matter of updating
`package.json` with new package names and versions, and updating your
imports.

To help find the proper package versions you can either browse to the
packages you need or check out the list of Git tags either on
Github [3] or by cloning the repository and running the `git tag`
command. All package versions get a tag in the format
_package@version_.

Update your `package.json` with the latest package version and add the
@sb1 scope to the package name:

```diff
- "ffe-core": "11.0.2",
+ "@sb1/ffe-core": "11.0.2",
```

Scoped packages all get put in a subdirectory in `node_modules/`. In our
case packages will be put in the `node_modules/@sb1/` directory. If your
build depends on file paths (for instance for copying fonts) you need to
update that path to include the scope.

The directory structure also means you have to update your imports, both
in Less and in JavaScript.

Using `less-plugin-npm-import`:

```diff
- @import 'npm://ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import 'npm://@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

Using Webpack:

```diff
- @import '~ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import '~@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

Using plain old paths:

```diff
- @import '../path/to/node_modules/ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import '../path/to/node_modules/@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

JavaScript `import`:

```diff
- import { ActionButton } from 'ffe-buttons-react';
+ import { ActionButton } from '@sb1/ffe-buttons-react';
```

JavaScript `require`:

```diff
- const { ActionButton } = require('ffe-buttons-react').default;
+ const { ActionButton } = require('@sb1/ffe-buttons-react').default;
```
