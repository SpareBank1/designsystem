### BREAKING CHANGES

-   **ffe-core:** The Hawaii layout system has been layed out in
    a different module, `ffe-layout-legacy`. If you're still using it then
    you will find the section-wrapper and content-container CSS
    classes there. If you're already using `ffe-grid` then there should
    be nothing breaking about this change.

# 12.0.0 (2018-02-25)

### Bug Fixes

-   **ffe-core:** Avoid subpixel calculation error for ffe-divider-line ([133b0d0](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/133b0d0))
-   **ffe-core:** Re-add property `sb1.StaticResources` in `package.json`. ([7b3e30c](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/7b3e30c))

### Chores

-   add [@sb1](https://github.com/sb1)/ scope to all packages ([37efbb4](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/37efbb4))

### Features

-   **ffe-core:** Add --inline modifier to headings ([1a61f28](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/1a61f28))
-   **ffe-core:** Add contribute.md link to readme ([df68546](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/df68546))
-   **ffe-core:** Remove webfonts ([add6353](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/add6353))

### BREAKING CHANGES

-   All packages have been renamed to add the @sb1 scope.

See links [1] and [2] to read more about package scopes.

Unfortunately this requires you update both your dependencies in
`package.json` and all `import` or `require` statements in your code.
Also, you unfortunately have to upgrade all FFE packages at once due to
dependency between packages. If you are on the latest version prior to
this breaking change the upgrade should be a matter of updating
`package.json` with new package names and versions, and updating your
imports.

To help find the proper package versions you can either browse to the
packages you need or check out the list of Git tags either on
Github [3] or by cloning the repository and running the `git tag`
command. All package versions get a tag in the format
_package@version_.

Update your `package.json` with the latest package version and add the
@sb1 scope to the package name:

```diff
- "ffe-core": "11.0.2",
+ "@sb1/ffe-core": "11.0.2",
```

Scoped packages all get put in a subdirectory in `node_modules/`. In our
case packages will be put in the `node_modules/@sb1/` directory. If your
build depends on file paths (for instance for copying fonts) you need to
update that path to include the scope.

The directory structure also means you have to update your imports, both
in Less and in JavaScript.

Using `less-plugin-npm-import`:

```diff
- @import 'npm://ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import 'npm://@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

Using Webpack:

```diff
- @import '~ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import '~@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

Using plain old paths:

```diff
- @import '../path/to/node_modules/ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import '../path/to/node_modules/@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

JavaScript `import`:

```diff
- import { ActionButton } from 'ffe-buttons-react';
+ import { ActionButton } from '@sb1/ffe-buttons-react';
```

JavaScript `require`:

```diff
- const { ActionButton } = require('ffe-buttons-react').default;
+ const { ActionButton } = require('@sb1/ffe-buttons-react').default;
```

-   **ffe-core:** Webfonts are no longer included in `ffe-core`, but were
    moved into `ffe-webfonts`.

Because `ffe-webfonts` does not include TrueType fonts anymore, change
effectively drops support for Museo Sans webfont in IE 8 and older.

The less variable `@base-url` is not used any longer and there is
no need for consumers to declare it when using less from
`ffe-core`.

Upgrade: Install ffe-webfonts and include the less file accordingly the
package's README and change `@build-path` to `@fonts-path`.

# 10.2.0 (2017-12-22)

### Features

-   **ffe-core:** Add contribute.md link to readme

## 10.1.2

-   Reduced font size of `ffe-fontsize-form-input` from `18px` to `16px`.

## 10.1.1

-   Replaced hardcoded font-sizes with variables

# 10.1.0

-   Supports `--no-underline` modifier for `ffe-h*` classes. Only use these if there are anchors in menus with header-style typography when it's obvious from their context that they are clickable.

# 10.0.0

-   BREAKING: The new default for links is the underlined version. If you want links without underlines use the `--no-underline` modifier.
-   BREAKING: Element styling (via `ffe-element-styling.less` and `element-map.less`) is removed.

Element styling has been deprecated for several majors, so hopefully this will not be a heavy upgrade for most
applications. However, for those applications that still import and use these styles, the upgrade path consists of
adding some classes in your DOM:

-   Add `ffe-body-text` class to `<body />` tag.
-   Add `ffe-h[1-6]` classes to `<h[1-6] />` tags
-   Add `ffe-body-paragraph` class to `<p />` tags
-   Add `ffe-strong-text` class to `<strong />` tags
-   Add `ffe-em-text` class to `<em />` tags
-   Add `ffe-pre-text` class to `<pre />` tags
-   Add `ffe-link-text` class to `<a />` tags
-   Add `ffe-divider-line` class to `<hr />` tags
-   Add `ffe-fieldset` class to `<fieldset />` tags

# 9.3.0

-   Added cursor: pointer to `ffe-link-text`
-   Added support for modifier `--underline` to `ffe-link-text` for anchors with underline.

Prefer using the underlined variant. There will be an upcoming major release that makes it the new default.

Early adaptors of `v.9.3.0` who wants to be ready for the next major can start using `--no-underline` for
the links that they don't want underlined in the next major.

# 9.2.0

-   Added `motion.less`, which contains variables for common transitions

To migrate to this release, replace timing functions (including `ease-in`, `ease-out` and other functions that do not directly correspond to the variables) and duration with the variables that fit your use case. Make sure to specify which property to transition - avoid `all`.

For example `transition: all 0.15s ease;` may be replaced by `transition: transform @ffe-transition-duration @ffe-ease-in-out-back;`.

# 9.1.0

-   Definition of breakpoints and variables related to layout (`@app-width`, ...) have their own less files: `less/breakpoints.less` and `less/app-width.less`.
-   Each less file can be independently imported.
-   Better default for `@base-url` ("." instead of "/").

## 9.0.1

-   Added devDependency to ffe-lists in order to correctly style examples

# 9.0.0

-   BREAKING: List styling are removed from `ffe-core`. These styles are now available in `ffe-lists`.
-   BREAKING: `.ffe-number-list` is no more - use `ffe-lists`'s `.ffe-numbered-list`.
-   BREAKING: Removed `@ffe-sand-25` from colors.less, renamed other color variables.

To upgrade to this release, all references to the following variables must be replaced by their new names in your LESS code:

-   `@ffe-blue-flat` --> `@ffe-blue-cobalt`
-   `@ffe-blue-royal-light-wcag` --> `@ffe-blue-azure`
-   `@ffe-blue-royal-light` --> `@ffe-blue-deep-sky`
-   `@ffe-blue-royal-light-50` --> `@ffe-blue-sky`
-   `@ffe-blue-royal-light-20` --> `@ffe-blue-pale`
-   `@ffe-blue-royal-light-10` --> `@ffe-blue-ice`
-   `@ffe-green-wcag` --> `@ffe-green-shamrock`
-   `@ffe-green-dark-10` --> `@ffe-green-emerald`
-   `@ffe-green-wcag-20` --> `@ffe-green-mint`
-   `@ffe-orange-wcag` --> `@ffe-orange-fire`
-   `@ffe-orange-wcag-20` --> `@ffe-orange-salmon`
-   `@ffe-purple-wcag` --> `@ffe-purple-magenta`
-   `@ffe-sand-50` --> `@ffe-sand-ivory`
-   `@ffe-sand-25` --> `@ffe-sand`
-   `@ffe-grey-light-bg` --> `@ffe-grey-cloud`
-   `@ffe-grey-light` --> `@ffe-grey-silver`
-   `@ffe-grey-dark` --> `@ffe-grey-charcoal`

To save some time on searching and replacing, run this command from inside your repository:

for pair in ffe-blue-flat:ffe-blue-cobalt ffe-blue-royal-light-10:ffe-blue-ice ffe-blue-royal-light-20:ffe-blue-pale ffe-blue-royal-light-50:ffe-blue-sky ffe-blue-royal-light-wcag:ffe-blue-azure ffe-blue-royal-light:ffe-blue-deep-sky ffe-green-wcag-20:ffe-green-mint ffe-green-wcag:ffe-green-shamrock ffe-green-dark-10:ffe-green-emerald ffe-orange-wcag-20:ffe-orange-salmon ffe-orange-wcag:ffe-orange-fire ffe-purple-wcag:ffe-purple-magenta ffe-sand-50:ffe-sand-ivory ffe-sand-25:ffe-sand ffe-grey-light-bg:ffe-grey-cloud ffe-grey-light:ffe-grey-silver ffe-grey-dark:ffe-grey-charcoal; do old=${pair%%:_}; new=${pair##\_:}; echo "Changing $old to$new"; find . -type f -name '\*.less' -exec sed -i "s/$old/$new/g" {} \;; done

## 8.2.4

Adjusted colors to reflect design guidelines

## 8.2.3

Added color `@ffe-blue-royal-light-10` (background color of expandable table rows)

## 8.2.2

`ffe-divider-line`'s width explicitly set to 100% to make sure it divides its entire
container. This fixes an issue discovered when using the divider in a `ffe-grid` column.
It should not affect dividers used outside of flex-containers.

## 8.2.1

Change `ffe-section-wrapper--bg-blue-flat` text color selector from wildcard to individual for typography.
This fixes a bug where `ffe-secondary-button` inside a `ffe-section-wrapper--bg-blue-flat` would get
white text on a white background.

# 8.2.0

Added `--bg-blue` and `--bg-blue-flat` modifiers to `.ffe-section-wrapper`.
The `--bg-blue-flat` text color to `ffe-white` for all its children since the
default color does not work very well on dark blue backgrounds.

## 8.1.2

This release changes the font size and / or line-height for h2, h4 and h6 for
**desktop** users. In addition, the color of `.ffe-sub-lead-paragraph` has
changed from `@ffe-blue-royal` to `@ffe-black`.

**Visual diff**

Consumers of `.ffe-h2`, `.ffe-h4`, `.ffe-h6` and `.ffe-sub-lead-paragraph`
will have to update their visual baseline images. Since the actual changes will
be small and have a very small chance of actually breaking a design, this
change was introduced as a patch.

## 8.1.1

This release changes `@ffe-sand` from `#E1D5AF` to `#F8F5EB`

Since `@ffe-sand` after this change is more or less equal to the old
`@ffe-sand-25`, `@ffe-sand-25` is now in effect an alias for `@ffe-sand`.
This choice has been made to preserve backwards compatibility for the
Less code. Consumers of `@ffe-sand-25` should see no perceivable change.

The postfix usually indicates opacity relative to the base color, given
a white background color. In this case `@ffe-sand-25` would have become
too white, so it has been removed from the color palette.

**Visual diff**

Consumers of `@ffe-sand` and `@ffe-sand-50` will find the colors are
significantly lighter. This is by design, and considered a bugfix.

# 8.1.0

Added a class, ffe-screenreader-only, and styles for hiding page
elements visually, while retaining accessibility.

## 8.0.3

**Visual diff**

`@ffe-grey-light-bg` changes from `#F1F1EF` to `#F9F9F9`. This change
fixes problems with color contrast, and is considered a bugfix.

## 8.0.2

-   Fixes a bug where `box-sizing: border-box;` went missing

## 8.0.1

-   Readded normalize.css as a static file

# 8.0.0

-   Removing components from ffe-core (new modules created for them in their respective repos).
-   Updating examples to only include new ffe-core elements.
-   Updated normalize.css and added it as an npm dependency. (see https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md for changes since v.3.0.3)
-   Cleaned up example files. Removed navigation, javascript and unused styling.
-   Added a description for migrating to v8.0.0

### Migrating to v.8.0.0

_ffe-core_ has been split in several packages, and a few things have been removed.

#### Installing the latest FFE

To upgrade from 7.x you will need to install these packages:

```bash
$ npm install --save ffe-core ffe-buttons ffe-form ffe-lists ffe-tables ffe-tabs ffe-spinner
```

Remember to also update your Less imports
(example below is given [less-plugin-npm-import](https://github.com/less/less-plugin-npm-import) is used):

```less
@import 'npm://ffe-core/less/ffe';
@import 'npm://ffe-buttons/less/buttons';
@import 'npm://ffe-form/less/form';
@import 'npm://ffe-lists/less/lists';
@import 'npm://ffe-tables/less/tables';
@import 'npm://ffe-tabs/less/tabs';
@import 'npm://ffe-spinner/less/spinner';
```

#### Other breaking changes

`ffe-info-message` has been renamed to `ffe-field-info-message` (in `ffe-form`)
`ffe-info-message--error` is now `ffe-field-error-message`
`ffe-info-message--success` is now `ffe-field-success-message`

`ffe-clearfix` has been removed, which has consequences for `ffe-section-wrapper`.

If your design is dependent on the clearfix you must add it to your project yourself:

```less
/* In your Less, after importing ffe-core */
.ffe-section-wrapper {
    &:before,
    &:after {
        display: table;
        content: "";
    }
    &:after {
        clear: both;
    }
}
```

`ffe-button-group` was removed, but has been reintroduced in `ffe-buttons@2.1.0`.

If you want to keep using it and don't plan on upgrading to `ffe-buttons@2.1.0` soon you can add the following to your project:

```less
.ffe-button-group {
    padding: 40px 0;

    &--thin {

If you have used any of the `.ffe-shadow-buttons-whatever()` mixins they are now `.ffe-buttons-shadow-whatever()`.

#### "Gotchas"

-   `ffe-tab-button` is in `ffe-tabs`, not `ffe-buttons`

## 7.0.1

-   Minor fix: make button texts of loading buttons unselectable, the text is only of interest for
    screen readers and ought to remain invisible under all circumstances.

# 7.0.0

-   Breaking: removed `--inline` support from `.ffe-form-label`. It was just setting max-width to 100% which is not the same as inlining. Removed `max-width: 85%` from `ffe-form-label`. It's layout and doesn't belong in the component. It now defaults to browser default which should be `none`. If you were using `ffe-form-label ffe-form-label--inline` you can just use `ffe-form-label`. If you were relying on the max-width being 85% then action is required.
-   Breaking: removed support for deprecated `ffe-check-box` in favor of the arguably less aptly named `ffe-checkbox`. NOTE: Filename is also changed.
-   Breaking: removed support for deprecated `ffe-select-box` in favor of the arguably less aptly named `ffe-dropdown`.
-   Added CONTRIBUTE.md to clarify release procedures.
