* **ffe-accordion-react:** Remove "expandableContent" prop ([be8043d](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/be8043d))

* Upgrade ffe-icons-react to v4 ([01bc161](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/01bc161))


### Chores

* add [@sb1](https://github.com/sb1)/ scope to all packages ([37efbb4](https://github.com/SpareBank1/designsystem/commit/37efbb4))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* All packages have been renamed to add the @sb1 scope.

See links [1] and [2] to read more about package scopes.

Unfortunately this requires you update both your dependencies in
`package.json` and all `import` or `require` statements in your code.
Also, you unfortunately have to upgrade all FFE packages at once due to
dependency between packages. If you are on the latest version prior to
this breaking change the upgrade should be a matter of updating
`package.json` with new package names and versions, and updating your
imports.

To help find the proper package versions you can either browse to the
packages you need or check out the list of Git tags either on
Github [3] or by cloning the repository and running the `git tag`
command. All package versions get a tag in the format
_package@version_.

Update your `package.json` with the latest package version and add the
@sb1 scope to the package name:

```diff
- "ffe-core": "11.0.2",
+ "@sb1/ffe-core": "11.0.2",
```

Scoped packages all get put in a subdirectory in `node_modules/`. In our
case packages will be put in the `node_modules/@sb1/` directory. If your
build depends on file paths (for instance for copying fonts) you need to
update that path to include the scope.

The directory structure also means you have to update your imports, both
in Less and in JavaScript.

Using `less-plugin-npm-import`:

```diff
- @import 'npm://ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import 'npm://@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

Using Webpack:

```diff
- @import '~ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import '~@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

Using plain old paths:

```diff
- @import '../path/to/node_modules/ffe-core/less/ffe';
+ @import '../path/to/node_modules/@sb1/ffe-core/less/ffe';
```

JavaScript `import`:

```diff
- import { ActionButton } from 'ffe-buttons-react';
+ import { ActionButton } from '@sb1/ffe-buttons-react';
```

JavaScript `require`:

```diff
- const { ActionButton } = require('ffe-buttons-react').default;
+ const { ActionButton } = require('@sb1/ffe-buttons-react').default;
```

* **ffe-accordion-react:** Replace "expandedContent" with children- & title- prop

This commit changes the structure of ffe-accordion-react by making
the expandable content of the accordion item the children, while the heading of the item
is now a new "title"-prop. This previous soulution was somewhat backwards,
while this change will be more the React way of doing things.

## 3.1.2

* Added documentation and refactored internally.

## 3.1.1

* Removed button and replaced with div to fix bug in internet explorer

Upgraded ffe-accordian to remove warning.

## 3.0.1

* Fix a propType error that would happen if isOpen was not set on AccordionItem. Collapse complained that
`this.state.isOpen` was undefined, so it now defaults to the boolean `false`.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Changing to use flex to align items instead of absolute positioning

# 2.1.0

Set `type="button"` for Button-toggler to prevent submit when accordion is used inside a form.

## .2.0.3

* Use PropTypes from prop-types package
