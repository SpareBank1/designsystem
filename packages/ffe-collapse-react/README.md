# @sb1/ffe-collapse-react

React component for expand/collapse

## Install

```
npm install --save @sb1/ffe-collapse-react
```

## Usage

Run Styleguidist from the repository root to see live examples and documentation,
or see the markdown files next to the component code in `src/`.

Please note the component depends on transition styling for `height`.\
This can preferably be done by importing the less-file from the less-folder
in the package.\
Alternatively you can do it by adding style to the class
`.ffe-collapse-transition`\, adding it to your own class and provide the class
through the `className` property or by styling it directly through the `style` property.
